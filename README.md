# Hovering-Slides

This project is a website with cards that expand and show more information when they are hovered over. The cards have a background image and a title that rotates 90 degrees when hovered over. When the card is expanded, text appears with additional information. The design of the cards is clean and modern, with a simple color scheme and a sans-serif font. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to achieve the hover effect and expandable card functionality.
